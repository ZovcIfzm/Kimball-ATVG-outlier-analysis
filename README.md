# Kimball-ATVG-outlier-analysis

While we've written a makefile for the project, (run "make run") the code itself is just a python file, which you can run with the command:

```python3 clustering_outliers.py --counts_file count_output.txt --show_plots 1```

The only other step needed is to download the python packages which can be done with

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
